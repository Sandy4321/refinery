What is Refinery?
===============
Built mostly in Python, Refinery is a full-stack web app that works with Vagrant VM and Puppet that can be 
run from a single command after downloading the git repository. 


Installing and Running Refinery
===============
Refinery is a browser driven web application built primarily off of Python. It was developed with the requirement that its implementation process be as simple as possible. Refinery requires three main packages - Git, Virtualbox, and Vagrant VM. VirtualBox and Vagrant VM allows Refinery to exist within a virtual machine that is accessible through your browser. The Vagrant package allows for the deployment of a Puppet manifest, which enables the automated installation of a large number of necessary software modules. It **_requires approximately 2.3GB of hard drive space_** and a relatively fast Internet connection. **_Installation will run roughly 20-30 minutes of your time using a high-speed Internet connection_** so please keep that in mind before installing. Git is needed to clone the repository that will contain the main source code, but if you don't wish to use Git, you can always just download the zip file and uncompress it to a folder you like. However, you'll still need these two pieces of software:

* [Oracle VM VirtualBox (working for v5.0)](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant (working for v1.8.1)](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

To modify the installation process, the configuration file **VagrantFile** located within the root directory contains settings that help guide this process. Installation of Refinery is as follows from the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/daeilkim/refinery.git
    vagrant up

After this command, Refinery will be booting up the virtual machine and loading up the web server. You'll need to then open up any browser and go to this URL: **http://11.11.11.11:8080**. You should see a login screen afterwards which you can login with:

    username: doc
    password: refinery

To see how you Refinery works, you can watch this [video](https://youtu.be/7yRQ1J9Z_LI) which shows a basic run-through using one of the included datasets within the repository.
